The Network Drive Manager application is a user-friendly tool built with Python's ttkbootstrap library to manage network drive connections on a Windows system. 
It features a graphical interface with two main buttons: "Connect All Drives" and "Disconnect All Drives."
The application allows users to connect to specified network drives using predefined paths and credentials, as well as disconnect these drives. 
It utilizes the subprocess module to execute the necessary system commands for managing network drives and provides feedback through message boxes to inform the user of successful operations or errors.
